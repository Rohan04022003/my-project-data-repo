# ðŸ“¦ Portfolio Project Data

This repository contains structured data and assets (images) for my portfolio projects.  
It is used as a headless content source for my frontend portfolio app built with React + TypeScript.

## ðŸ”¹ Whatâ€™s inside?

- `data/projects.json` â†’ All project metadata (title, stack, features, links)
- `public/images/` â†’ Screenshots for each project

This structure allows easy maintenance and scalability for portfolio websites.

> Feel free to fork or reference it for your own portfolio setup!
